<p><strong>Postdoctoral position in Cancer Epigenetics/Immunobiology
  
</strong></p>
<p>The Micevic Lab is currently seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher with a strong interest and experience in the fields of T-cell biology, immunology, and epigenetics. The group is broadly interested in cancer immunology with specific interests in identifying epigenetic mechanisms regulating CD8 T cell memory formation and exhaustion. Using  mouse models, single cell approaches (scRNA-Seq, ATACseq), genetic perturbation tools (CRISPR) and clinical tissues samples, the group aims to lay the foundation for the next-generation of cancer immunotherapies. The position is based in New Haven, CT at Yale University, one of the world's leading locations for life sciences. Relevant background: https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2304319120 </p>
<p><strong>Your profile  </strong></p>
<p>Required</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ph.D. in Molecular Biology/ Biochemistry, Immunology, Cancer immunobiology, genetics or related fields.</li>
  <li>Demonstrated expertise (peer-reviewed publications) in the fields of immunology, cancer biology and/or epigenetics.</li>
  <li>Experience in immunology techniques (flow cytometry, T-cell based assays, ELISA).</li>
  <li>Proficient with molecular biology techniques (cell culture, RNA extraction etc. ).</li>
  <li>Fluency in English, excellent written and communication skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferred</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experience with single cell experiments, epigenetic (ATAC-Seq, ChIP-Seq) is considered a plus.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Your position</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Planning, designing, and executing experiments.
  </li>
  <li>Analyzing, structuring, and presenting data. </li>
  <li>Participating in and developing collaborative projects with Ph.D. students and staff scientists.</li>
  <li>Preparation of scientific reports, meetings, journal articles and funding applications.</li>
  <li> Communicating science at local and international meetings.</li>
  <li>Participating in common lab tasks.</li>
  <li>Opportunities for mentoring PhD students. </li>
</ul>
