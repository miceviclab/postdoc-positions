<p><strong>1) Postdoctoral position in Cancer Epigenetics/Immunobiology
  
</strong></p>
<p>The Micevic Lab is currently seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher with a strong interest and experience in the fields of T-cell biology, immunology, and epigenetics. The group is broadly interested in cancer immunology with specific interests in identifying epigenetic mechanisms regulating CD8 T cell memory formation and exhaustion. Using  mouse models, single cell approaches (scRNA-Seq, ATACseq), genetic perturbation tools (CRISPR) and clinical tissues samples, the group aims to lay the foundation for the next-generation of cancer immunotherapies. The position is based in New Haven, CT at Yale University, one of the world's leading locations for life sciences. Relevant background: https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2304319120 </p>
<p><strong>Your profile  </strong></p>
<p>Required</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ph.D. in Molecular Biology/ Biochemistry, Immunology, Cancer immunobiology, genetics or related fields.</li>
  <li>Demonstrated expertise (peer-reviewed publications) in the fields of immunology, cancer biology and/or epigenetics.</li>
  <li>Experience in immunology techniques (flow cytometry, T-cell based assays, ELISA).</li>
  <li>Proficient with molecular biology techniques (cell culture, RNA extraction etc. ).</li>
  <li>Fluency in English, excellent written and communication skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferred</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experience with single cell experiments, epigenetic (ATAC-Seq, ChIP-Seq) is considered a plus.</li>

  <li>Analyzing, structuring, and presenting data. </li>
  <li>Participating in and developing collaborative projects with Ph.D. students and staff scientists.</li>
  <li>Preparation of scientific reports, meetings, journal articles and funding applications.</li>
  <li> Communicating science at local and international meetings.</li>
  <li>Participating in common lab tasks.</li>
  <li>Opportunities for mentoring PhD students. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please send your CV, a cover letter and names of three references to Dr. Goran Micevic (goran.micevic at yale.edu) with subject line &quot;Micevic Lab&quot; by June 16. </p>
<p>2) <strong>Postdoctoral position in  Computational Biology</strong></p>
<p>We apply  high-throughput single-cell multi-omics profiling (e.g., scRNA-seq, TCR-Seq, ATAC-seq, Methyl-Seq) to help decipher the cell signaling, epigenetic/transcriptomic  regulation that is important for cancer immunology,  as well as develop T cell-based  cancer immune therapies. </p>
<p><strong>Required</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ph.D. in Computational Biology, Bioinformatics or related life sciences  field.</li>
  <li>Demonstrated expertise (peer-reviewed publications) in  analyzing single-cell and/or spatial transcriptomic datasets.</li>
  <li>Experience with <span data-markjs="true"><span data-markjs="true">UNIX</span></span>/Linux command line, high performance computational cluster use.</li>
  <li>Fluency in English, excellent written and communication skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your positionÂ </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Planning and helping design single-cell and/or spatial transcriptomic experiments (scRNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, CUT&amp;RUN, TCR-Seq, ChIP-Seq, CosMx). </li>
  <li>Analyzing transcriptional, epigenetic and spatial  data. </li>
  <li>Participating in and developing collaborative projects with postdocs and Ph.D. students.</li>
